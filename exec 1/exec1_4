Three Random Variables

Simply looking at the image one could assume that if the property C is present,
then the item will not have property B and if property C is present,
property A is also likely to be present.

The solution can be discovered via Conditional Probability.
In case two variables A and B are not independent
(ie. the occurence of one does not affect the other 
(in which case the probability that both variables are true is simply the probability of B)),
the probability that both occur is defined by the following formula:
P(B|A) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(A).

From this definition, the conditional probability P(B|A) is obtained by dividing by P(A).
The formula assumes that the probability of A is > 0,
which it is in the provided set in the assignment.

Using the following notation:
- Ap: A=1 item has property A
- Bp: B=1 item has property B
- Cp: C=1 item has property C

And using the formula introduced above, we may obtain that P(B = 1|C = 1) = P(Bp|Cp) = 0/0.5 = 0
and P(A = 1|C = 1) = P(Ap|Cp) = 0.5/0.5 = 1.
This proves what could already be assumed by simply looking at the provided set,
if an item has property B, C is sure not to be present and if an item has property C,
then A is also present.

Based on the above, both predictions are possible based on the provided set.
